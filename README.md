SnappyTree is a procedural tree creation app designed to demo [proctree.js](https://github.com/supereggbert/proctree.js).  SnappyTree produces [proctree.js](https://github.com/supereggbert/proctree.js) JSON which can be used to generate trees client side in other web applications/games.  In addition, SnappyTree also provides export options for wavefront and collada file formats so the generated trees can be used in other native applications.
